**SearchSavvy** is a project that aims to create a blog management system with user and TF-IDF search features. It uses Spring Boot and Gradle as the main technologies for developing and building the application. Here is a brief explanation of each key feature and the issue with the initial TF-IDF score calculation:
- **User Management:** This feature allows users to create and manage their profiles on the blog system. Users can sign up with their email and mobile, and edit their personal information, such as name, mobile, email, and avatar. Users can also retrieve their profiles by their unique ID, which is generated by the system.
- **Blog Management:** This feature allows users to create and publish new blogs on the system. Users can write their blogs. Users can also update and modify their existing blogs with new content. Additionally, users can retrieve all the published blogs on the system for viewing or further processing, and users can also retrieve blogs by their unique ID, which is generated by the system.
- **TF-IDF Search:** This feature allows users to search for relevant blogs based on their queries. It uses the TF-IDF algorithm, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This algorithm assigns a weight to each word in a document based on how often it appears in the document and how rare it is in the whole collection of documents. The higher the weight, the more important the word is for the document. By multiplying the term frequency and the inverse document frequency, the algorithm produces a TF-IDF score for each word in each document. The documents with the highest TF-IDF scores for the query words are then ranked and returned as the search results
- **Addressing the Initial TF-IDF Score Calculation Issue:** During the first blog creation, there might be an issue with calculating the TF-IDF score, because there are no existing blogs to compare with. This might result in the default maximum value being returned as the score, which is not accurate. A potential solution to this issue is to update the first blog after adding more blogs to the system, so that the TF-IDF score can be recalculated based on the updated collection of documents
